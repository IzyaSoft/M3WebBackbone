 *
 * >>>>> THE SD CARD MUST BE INSERTED FOR THIS DEMO TO EXECUTE! <<<<<
 *
 *
 * This demo provides the following functionality:
 *
 * --- SD Card MMC Driver for FAT File System ---
 * A FAT compatible file file system is hosted on an SD card that uses an SPI
 * interface. The FreeRTOS+IO API is used with an SSP peripheral to provide the
 * necessary input and output. FatFS is used to provide the file system
 * functionality.
 *
 * The example demonstrates files being written to and read from the SD card
 * using all the available FreeRTOS+IO transfer modes. The file name is used to
 * indicate the mode being used when the file was created, and 20 files are
 * created using each mode.
 *
 * The files can be listed and manipulated using FreeRTOS+CLI - see below.
 *
 *
 * --- Telnet "like" Command Console ---
 * FreeRTOS+CLI creates a command console on the standard telnet TCP/IP port
 * (port 23). The lwIP sockets API is used to provide the TCP/IP
 * implementation.
 *
 * The command console uses the telnet port number, and can be accessed using a
 * standard telnet client, but it is not a full telnet server.
 *
 * The example uses a static IP address that is configured using the
 * configIP_ADDR0-configIP_ADDR3 constants defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h.
 *
 * Five commands are registered with FreeRTOS+CLI. These are dir, copy and del
 * to manipulate the file system (see above), and run-time-stats and task-stats
 * to view FreeRTOS task information.  See FreeRTOS-Plus-Demo-1 for example CLI 
 * command definitions that demonstrate parsing a variable number of 
 * parameteres.
 *
 * Enter "dir" in the command console to see a file system directory listing.
 *
 * Enter "del <filename>" in the command console to delete a file from the SD
 * card.
 *
 * Enter "copy <source_file> <destination_file>" in the command console to copy
 * a file.
 *
 * Enter "run-time-stats" in the command console to see the amount of time each
 * task has spent in the Running state since it was created.
 *
 * Enter "task-stats" in the command console to see a snapshot of task state
 * information - including stack high water mark data.
 *
 *
 * --- A web Server ---
 * The lwIP raw API is used to create a simple web server. The web server uses
 * server side includes (SSI) to display task state and run time information.
 *
 *
 * --- GPIO ---
 * FreeRTOS software timers are used to periodically toggle the multi-coloured
 * LEDs.
